This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours** with your WhatConverts account. You'll learn how to track calls, SMS, and form submissions seamlessly while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

## WhatConverts Webhooks (custom integration)

For advanced tracking and to access detailed event data, you can set up a custom integration with WhatConverts. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Source in Ours Privacy**:

   * In the Ours app, navigate to **Sources** and create a new source.
   * Select **WhatConverts** from the options and copy the Webhook URL provided.

2. **Subscribe to Webhooks in WhatConverts**:

3. **Submit a Test Event**:

   * Trigger a test event (e.g., make a call or fill out a form) to ensure data is sent to Ours.
   * Check the Ours app for pre-populated variables from the event payload.

4. **Map Extra Event Fields**:

   * Use the field mapping interface in Ours to map WhatConverts event data to Ours attributes.
   * The default integration has all important properties mapped, but you can add custom form fields to Ours Privacy if needed.
