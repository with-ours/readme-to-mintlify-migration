## Nextdoor Ads Features

The Ours Nextdoor Ads feature allows you to securely track conversions and other events for Nextdoor Ads in a HIPAA-compliant manner. By routing all events through our server, we ensure that Nextdoor never interacts directly with your clients' browsers. We also allow you to redact and/or hash data before it is sent over to Nextdoor.

With Ours, you can capture meaningful engagement data while safeguarding privacy, helping your Nextdoor Ads account stay compliant and optimized with actionable insights.

Ours automatically captures the Nextdoor click ID (`ndclid`) from the URL query string and saves it for dispatching future events.

The Nextdoor Conversion API (CAPI) allows Ours to send events directly from our servers to Nextdoor's servers, bypassing the client browser. This server-to-server connection enhances privacy by keeping user information secure and avoiding direct exposure of user data to Nextdoor.

## Configuring a Nextdoor destination

To add a destination, click on [Destinations](https://app.oursprivacy.com/) from your Ours platform. Click the **Add destination** button and select Nextdoor as the destination type to add.

Then, copy and paste your **Nextdoor Client ID** (this is your Advertiser ID from Nextdoor), your **Nextdoor API Access Token** (usually provided by the Nextdoor support team), and your **Nextdoor Pixel ID** (your web pixel for deduplication) into the Ours destination configuration tool. After successful configuration, you will see a message that says "Your destination is configured and ready."
