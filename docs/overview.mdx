# Overview

Ours Privacy is a privacy-first analytics and ad tracking platform for healthcare. It helps you securely understand your marketing performance while remaining HIPAA-compliant.

## Why Use Ours?

Traditional ad tracking tools aren’t built for regulated industries like healthcare. Ours Privacy gives you all the benefits of attribution, user behavior insights, and platform integrations—without compromising on security or compliance.

By acting as a secure intermediary between your website and third-party platforms (like Meta and Google), Ours Privacy ensures patient data is handled with care.

## How It Works

Here’s how Ours Privacy fits into your existing stack:

1. You install the Ours Privacy script on your site.
2. It automatically captures events like page views, form submissions, and conversions.
3. It stores attribution info like `gclid` and `fbclid` securely.
4. Data is dispatched to your connected destinations (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.), with options for you to redact or hash sensitive info.

You stay in control of what’s tracked and where it goes.

## Key Features

* HIPAA-safe event tracking
