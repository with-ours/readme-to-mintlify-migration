This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours** with your Calendly account. You’ll learn how to track bookings and custom events seamlessly while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

## Calendly Redirect (easy integration)

The simplest way to integrate Ours with Calendly is to set up a redirect after booking. Here's how:

1. Make sure your Ours tracking script is installed on your website.
2. Link from your website to a Calendly booking page.
3. Set up a custom thank-you page in Calendly to redirect back to your website.

On your thank-you page, fire this Ours event:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('track', 'BookingCompleted');
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This method requires no complex integration and provides basic tracking. Configure the redirect in your Calendly booking page settings.

> **Note:** Some features may require a paid Calendly plan.

## Calendly Embed Google Tag Manager Triggers

Another way to track conversions on Calendly is to embed the scheduler on your website.

You can then listen to schedule events via the on-website events Calendly publishes.

* Download the [GTM template we created here and import it to GTM](https://gist.github.com/tylerzey/749a67ebe655649c4e3bf2c18a48552e)
* You can then trigger Ours inside of GTM with the above Calendly Triggers

## Ours Calendly Source (custom integration)

For more advanced tracking and to access booking details, you can set up a custom integration with Calendly. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Source**:

   * In the Ours app, navigate to **Sources** and create a new source.
   * Select **Calendly** from the options and copy the Webhook URL provided.

2. **Subscribe to Webhooks in Calendly**:

   * Go to your Calendly account settings.
   * Add a new webhook and paste the Ours Webhook URL.
   * Subscribe to the **Booking Created** event to capture booking data.

> **Note:** Webhook access requires a paid Calendly plan.

3. **Submit a Test Booking**:

   * Make a test booking to ensure data is sent to Ours.
   * Check the Ours app for pre-populated variables from the booking payload.

4. **Map Booking Fields**:

   * Use the field mapping interface in Ours to map Calendly booking data to Ours attributes.
   * Include at least the **Ours visitor ID** and optionally an email address for user association.

### Advanced Source Integration

To link Ours visitor data with Calendly bookings:

1. **Add a Hidden Field in Calendly**:

   * Set up a hidden field in your booking page to capture the **Ours User ID**.
   * Calendly recommends using `utm_term` for this [Docs](https://community.calendly.com/featured-tips-tricks-32/hidden-fields-what-they-are-and-how-to-use-them-1929)

2. **Pass Visitor ID via UTM Parameter**:

   * When linking to the Calendly booking page, append the Ours User ID as a UTM parameter. Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  <a href="https://calendly.com/your-booking-page?utm_term={{ours_user_id}}">Book Now</a>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

3. **Map Hidden Field**:
   * Map the hidden field in the Ours app to the visitor ID for accurate user tracking.
