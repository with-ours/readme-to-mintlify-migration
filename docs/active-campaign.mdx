3. **Configure Contact Updates**:

   * Ours have a default mapper that will map known fields in ours to ActiveCampaign. If you have custom fields in ActiveCampaign, you may want to modify the default mapper so that it sends over more data.

4. **Submit a Test Event**:

   * Trigger a test event in Ours to ensure contact updates are sent to ActiveCampaign.
   * Check your ActiveCampaign account to verify that the contact has been updated or created.
