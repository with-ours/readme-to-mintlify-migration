# Data Retention in Ours Privacy

Ours Privacy retains your data in a secure environment. By default, data is stored without a predefined limit, giving you the flexibility to analyze trends over any time frame. However, you can choose to set a custom retention period that automatically removes data once it exceeds that time window.

***

## Minimum Required Retention

We require **at least one month** of data retention to enable essential features, such as historical analysis and visitor journey insights. If you try to set a shorter period, we'll automatically default it to one month.

***

## Setting a Custom Retention Period

1. **Access Retention Settings** In your Ours Privacy dashboard, go to **Advanced Features** â†’ **Data Retention**.

2. **Choose Your Time Window** Enter the number of months you want to retain data. For example, entering `3` means data older than 3 months will be removed.

3. **Save Your Changes** Once confirmed, Ours Privacy will review your account, reach out if there are any concerns, and then process your request.

## Data Deletion

When data ages beyond your configured retention window, it's automatically removed from our systems around the first Monday of every month.

**Important:** Once data is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Ensure your retention window aligns with both your compliance needs and analytical requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I change my retention window at any time?** Yes. You can adjust your retention window at any time. Data older than the new cutoff will be removed, and removed data cannot be restored.

**Q: What if I have a compliance request to remove data sooner?** You can perform a manual deletion through our interface or contact our support team for urgent removal.

**Q: How does deleting older data affect my analytics?** Any reports or dashboards requiring data older than the retention window will no longer include that historical information.

**Q: Can I keep all data indefinitely?** If you don't set a custom retention window, we will store your data according to your agreements with Ours Privacy.

**Q: Does data retention affect data sent to destinations?** No. Data retention only affects data stored within Ours Privacy's systems. Any data that has already been sent to destinations (like Facebook, Google Analytics, etc.) will remain in those systems according to their respective retention policies.
