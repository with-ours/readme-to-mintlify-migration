# Error Handling

Ours is designed to ensure high reliability and robust error management for your data. This guide explains how Ours handles errors during event ingestion and forwarding, including multi-region redundancy for data reliability and a retry mechanism for external destination failures.

***

## Multi-Region Redundancy for Ingestion

Ours uses a **multi-region setup** to provide fault-tolerant ingestion of your events. This ensures that your data is reliably captured, even if a regional data center experiences downtime.

***

## Retry Mechanism for External Destination Failures

When forwarding events to external destinations (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads), Ours employs a robust retry mechanism to ensure data delivery, even if the destination is temporarily unavailable.

### Retry Logic:

1. **Automatic Retries**:
   * If a request to an external destination fails, Ours automatically retries the request.
2. **Exponential Backoff**:
   * Retries are spaced out using exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the destination.
3. **48-Hour Retry Window**:
   * Ours will continue retrying failed requests for up to **48 hours**.
4. **Error Logging**:
   * Detailed error logs are maintained for every failed request, available in the [Recent Events Dashboard](/docs/tracking-and-debugging-events).

### Common Failure Scenarios and Resolutions

| **Scenario**                       | **How Ours Handles It**                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Temporary Destination Downtime** | Retries the request until the destination becomes available.        |
| **Rate-Limiting by Destination**   | Adapts retry intervals to avoid hitting rate limits.                |
| **Invalid Configuration**          | Logs the error and provides debugging details for quick resolution. |
| **Network Errors**                 | Retries with exponential backoff to handle transient issues.        |

### Monitoring Retry Status:

* Use the **Recent Events Dashboard** to:

  * Identify failed dispatches to destinations.
  * View detailed error messages and retry status.
  * Confirm successful retries after issues are resolved.

## Best Practices for Error Handling

1. **Configure Destinations Correctly**:
   * Ensure API keys, credentials, and mappings are set up correctly for each destination.
2. **Validate Events Before Sending**:
   * Use the allowlist and data mapping tools to ensure events are properly formatted and configured.

***

## Debugging Errors

When errors occur, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check the Recent Events Dashboard**:
   * Identify the affected events and view error details.
2. **Inspect Configuration**:
   * Verify destination settings and ensure required fields are included in the event.
3. **Reach Out for Support**:
   * Contact [Ours Support](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#02717772726d7076426d77707172706b7463617b2c616d6f) if an issue persists.

## Summary

Ours ensures robust error handling and data reliability with:

* **Multi-Region Ingestion**: Guarantees high availability and fault tolerance for event tracking.
* **48-Hour Retry Mechanism**: Ensures events are delivered to external destinations, even during temporary failures.

To get started:

* Debug failed requests using the [Recent Events Dashboard](/docs/tracking-and-debugging-events).
* Explore [Destination Configuration](/docs/destination-overview) to optimize your setup.
