# Ours Integration with Typeform

This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours** with your Typeform account. Youâ€™ll learn how to track form submissions and custom events seamlessly while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

## Typeform Redirect (easy integration)

The simplest way to integrate Ours with Typeform is to set up a redirect within Typeform. Here's how:

1. Make sure your Ours tracking script is installed on your website.
2. Link from your website to Typeform.
3. Set up a custom thank-you page in Typeform to redirect back to your website.

On your thank-you page, fire this Ours event:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('track', 'FormSubmitted', { conversion: true });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This method requires no complex integration and provides basic tracking. Configure the redirect in your Typeform settings:
