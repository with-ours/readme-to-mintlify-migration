# Global Consent Center

The **Global Consent Center** provides centralized consent management for controlling event dispatch to destinations. Instead of configuring consent logic individually in each destination, you can create category-based rules that evaluate consent properties and control dispatch across multiple destinations simultaneously.

***

## Overview

The Global Consent Center allows you to:

* **Create consent categories** (e.g., "Ads", "Analytics", "Marketing") with custom logic rules
* **Assign destinations to categories** to control which platforms are affected by each rule
* **Use the same logic builder** as destination mappers to evaluate visitor and event properties
* **Set rule priorities** to control the order of evaluation
* **Centralize consent management** instead of configuring individual destination mappers

## How It Works

The Global Consent Center operates in the event dispatch flow:

**Event → Allow List → Global Consent Center → Destination Mapping → Dispatch**

1. **Event Processing**: Events are first checked against your allow list
2. **Consent Evaluation**: The Global Consent Center evaluates consent rules in priority order
3. **Dispatch Control**: If an event matches a category's logic (evaluates to TRUE), dispatch is stopped for all destinations assigned to that category
4. **Normal Dispatch**: Events that don't match any opt-out category logic dispatch normally to all allowed destinations

***

## Use Cases

### Marketing Consent Control

Create an "Ads" category that stops dispatch to Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and TikTok Ads when marketing consent is not granted:

* **Category**: "Ads"
* **Logic**: `visitor.consent.marketing` is falsy
* **Destinations**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads

### Analytics Consent Management

Set up an "Analytics" category to control data flow to analytics platforms:

* **Category**: "Analytics"
* **Logic**: `visitor.consent.analytics` is falsy
* **Destinations**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude

### Event-Specific Consent

Use event properties to control dispatch based on consent passed with individual events:

* **Category**: "Event Marketing"
* **Logic**: `event.consent_marketing` is falsy
* **Destinations**: Marketing automation platforms

## Configuration

### Enabling the Global Consent Center

1. Navigate to the **Global Consent Center** in your Ours Privacy dashboard
2. Toggle **"Enable Consent Center"** to activate the feature
3. Begin creating categories and rules

### Creating Categories

1. Click **"+ Add Category"** to create a new consent category
2. **Name your category** (e.g., "Ads", "Analytics", "Marketing")
3. **Set priority** using the up/down arrows (lower numbers = higher priority)
4. **Configure logic** using the logic builder to define when dispatch should be stopped

### Logic Builder

The Global Consent Center uses the same logic builder as destination mappers. You can evaluate:

* **Visitor properties**: `visitor.consent.marketing`, `visitor.consent.analytics`
* **Event properties**: `event.consent_marketing`, `event.consent_analytics`
* **Complex conditions**: Multiple properties with AND/OR logic

**Important**: Write conditions that evaluate to TRUE when you want to STOP dispatch. For example:

* `visitor.consent.ads` is falsy → Stops dispatch when ads consent is not granted
* `event.consent_marketing` is falsy → Stops dispatch when marketing consent is not provided

***

## Rule Priority and Evaluation

### Priority System

* Rules are evaluated in priority order (lower numbers first)
* If an event matches multiple categories, the first matching rule takes precedence
* You can reorder priorities using the up/down arrows in the interface

### Default Behavior

* **Matched events**: Stop dispatch to destinations assigned to the matching category
* **Unmatched events**: Dispatch normally to all allowed destinations
* **Unassigned destinations**: Always dispatch normally (not affected by Global Consent Center)

***

## Integration with Consent Management Platforms

### Ours Privacy CMP

When using the Ours Privacy Cookie Consent Management Platform, consent properties are automatically populated and available for use in Global Consent Center rules.

### Third-Party CMPs

For other consent management platforms, continue passing consent status as event or visitor properties.

***

## Testing and Debugging

### Dispatch Reasons

When events are stopped by the Global Consent Center, you can see which rule matched in the dispatch logs. This helps with testing and debugging your consent configuration.

### Testing Workflow

1. **Configure rules** in the Global Consent Center
2. **Test events** with different consent properties
3. **Review dispatch logs** to verify rules are working correctly
4. **Check destination data** to confirm events are being stopped appropriately

***

## Best Practices

### Rule Design

* **Use clear category names** that reflect the type of consent being managed
* **Write conditions that evaluate TRUE for opt-out scenarios** (when you want to stop dispatch)
* **Test thoroughly** with different consent combinations before going live
