# Ours Redirect Source

The Ours Redirect Source allows you to track events by redirecting users to a specified URL.

This is useful for tracking user interactions when they are redirected from one page to another. It is also useful for tracking events from external form platforms. You can have the form redirect to the Ours Redirect URL, track an event automatically associated to an existing user because their Cookies are set, and then redirect them back to your thank you page.

Specifically - This is useful for capturing conversions from form platforms that don't let you easily integrate with Webhooks or install the Ours Web SDK.

To add this source to your account, go to **Sources** > **Add Source**. Then, select the Redirect source. You can configure the redirect URL and query parameters before using it.

## How It Works

When a user clicks or visits the redirect link, they will be redirected to the URL you specify. The Ours system will then track an event for that user based on the query parameters provided.

## Customizing Parameters

You can essentially send in any custom data via the redirect tracking URL. The form in-app helps you customize your redirect URL so that it tracks the properties you want to track.
