# HubSpot Source Integration

This guide will walk you through setting up **HubSpot as a data source** to send form submissions and meeting events from your HubSpot account to **Ours Privacy**. You'll learn how to configure the integration so that HubSpot automatically sends data to Ours Privacy for **HIPAA-compliant analytics** and privacy-conscious event tracking.

> **Note:** If you're looking to send data **to HubSpot from Ours Privacy** (updating contacts in HubSpot based on visitor events), please see our [HubSpot Destination Integration](/docs/hubspot) instead.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* An active HubSpot account with admin access
* Access to HubSpot Workflows
* An Ours Privacy Account

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Source in Ours Privacy

1. Log in to your Ours Privacy dashboard
2. Navigate to **Sources** > **Create Source**
3. Search for "HubSpot" in the source catalog
4. Click on the HubSpot CRM source to begin setup

### 2) Authenticate with HubSpot

1. In the HubSpot source setup screen, click **Authenticate with HubSpot**
2. You'll be redirected to HubSpot's authorization page
3. Select the HubSpot account you want to connect
4. Grant the necessary permissions to Ours Privacy
5. You'll be redirected back to Ours Privacy once authentication is complete

### 3. Configure HubSpot Workflows

1. In HubSpot, navigate to **Automation** > **Workflows**
2. Create a new workflow or edit an existing one
3. Under **Actions**, look for the "Integrated apps" section
4. Find and select **Ours Privacy**
5. Click **Add action** to add the "Send event to Ours Privacy" action

### 4. Configure Event Settings

For each event you want to send to Ours Privacy, you'll need to configure:

1. **Action Key**: A unique identifier for this specific event (e.g., "form\_submission", "meeting\_scheduled")

2. **JSON Payload**: The data structure you want to send to Ours Privacy, which can include:

   * Contact properties
   * Custom fields
   * Event metadata

Example JSON payload:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "email": "{{contact.email}}",
    "firstName": "{{contact.firstname}}",
    "eventType": "form_submission",
    "formId": "{{form.id}}",
    "submissionDate": "{{submission.date}}"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

> **Note:** You will need to replace the bracketed variables above with the variables HubSpot gives you in their Workflow tool

## Data Mapping

Each event sent from HubSpot can be mapped differently in Ours Privacy. When configuring your events:

1. Use descriptive Action Keys to easily identify different event types
2. Structure your JSON payload to match your data requirements
3. Use HubSpot's property placeholders (e.g., `{{contact.email}}`) to dynamically insert data

## Best Practices

* Create separate workflow actions for different types of events
* Use clear, consistent naming conventions for Action Keys
* Test your workflow in HubSpot's test mode before activating
* Monitor event delivery in Ours Privacy's event logs

## Troubleshooting

If events aren't appearing in Ours Privacy:

1. Verify the workflow is activated in HubSpot
2. Check the JSON payload syntax
3. Ensure all required fields are included
4. Review the authentication status in both platforms
5. Ensure that your source is published and enabled

## Limitations

* Events are sent when workflow actions are triggered
* JSON payload must be valid and well-formed
* Some HubSpot properties may require specific formatting
* Maximum payload size is limited (consult HubSpot's current limits)
