# Ours Integration with Framer

Integrating **Ours** with Framer is straightforward and allows you to track page views and custom events securely and efficiently. This guide will walk you through the setup process using Framer’s **Custom Code** feature.

## Integration Options

The integration guide below covers using the [Ours Privacy Web SDK](/docs/web-sdk-javascript).

If you want to use Google Tag Manager instead, you can ignore the code examples and use traditional [Google Tag Manager Triggers](/docs/gtm-install) to fire your events.

Choose the approach that best suits your workflow.
