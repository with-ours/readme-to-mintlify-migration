## Overview

The Ours Privacy Taboola destination enables you to track conversions and other key events through a HIPAA-eligible, server-to-server integration with Taboola's conversion tracking system. By routing all events through our servers, Ours ensures that Taboola scripts and pixels are not directly on your website.

Ours Privacy automatically captures Taboola click IDs from the URL query string and saves them for dispatching future events to Taboola's postback URL.

This setup allows you to optimize your Taboola campaigns with accurate, privacy-safe conversion data while helping maintain compliance with healthcare and privacy regulations.

## Setup and Configuration

### Taboola Setup Requirements

Before configuring the Ours Taboola destination, you must complete the setup in your Taboola account.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to [Taboola's Manual S2S Integration Documentation](https://developers.taboola.com/pixel/docs/s2s-manual-integration).

### Query Parameter Mapping

**Important**: Ours Privacy automatically tracks the `clid` query parameter, not the `click_id` parameter that Taboola's documentation recommends. When setting up your Taboola campaigns:

In your Taboola campaign tracking URLs, use `clid={click_id}` instead of `click_id={click_id}`

**Example URL format:**

```
https://yoursite.com/landing-page?utm_source=taboola&utm_medium=referral&clid={click_id}
```
