## Account Management Features

Our platform provides comprehensive account management capabilities designed to help organizations scale securely and efficiently. From basic user management to advanced security controls, we offer the tools you need to maintain a secure and well-organized environment.

## Core Features

* **Advanced Permissioning System**: Our comprehensive permissioning system provides granular control over user access and capabilities within your organization. This includes predefined user roles, custom policy creation, and individual user permission management to ensure the right people have the right access at the right time.

* **HIPAA-Compliant Audit Logging**: Every action taken in our UI is tracked with robust audit logging that meets HIPAA compliance standards. This ensures you have a complete, secure record of user activity for compliance and peace of mind. If you need access to these logs for compliance or legal reasons, please reach out to your account manager to start a retrieval process.

* **User Management**: Take full control of your user base with our intuitive management tools. Update and manage user details—such as names, email addresses, passwords, and even two-factor authentication (2FA) settings—all from within the app. This ensures your team's credentials are up-to-date and your account remains secure.

* **One-Click Authentication**: Simplify your login process with one-click authentication options powered by Microsoft or Google. This streamlined approach not only enhances user convenience but also reinforces security by leveraging trusted authentication providers.

* **Multi-Account Login**: Seamlessly access and manage multiple accounts within the same browser tab. This feature allows you to switch between different user profiles without the need to log out, ensuring that you stay productive while keeping your workflows uninterrupted.

* **In-App Organization Management**: Manage your organization's structure directly from the app. Easily invite new users, assign or modify roles, and remove access when necessary. This centralized control helps you maintain a well-organized and secure environment as your team grows.

* **Verified Domain Addition**: Enhance user onboarding with verified domain addition. When you add a verified domain, any user with an email address associated with that domain is automatically integrated into your account, reducing manual setup and ensuring a consistent, secure experience.

* **Unlimited Users**: Designed with scalability in mind, our platform supports an unlimited number of users. Whether you're a small startup or a large enterprise, you can expand your team without worrying about hitting user limits, ensuring that your organization can grow as needed.
