## Partnerize Features

The Ours Partnerize destination enables you to track conversions and other key events through a secure, server-to-server integration. By routing all events through our servers, we ensure that sensitive data remains protected while accurately tracking your affiliate marketing performance.

## Configuring Partnerize

To add a destination, click on [Destinations](https://app.oursprivacy.com/) from your Ours platform. Click the **Add destination** button and select Partnerize as the destination type.

### Required Settings

| Setting          | Description                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Program ID       | Your Partnerize Program ID                      |
| Integration Type | The type of integration (defaults to 'DYNAMIC') |

## Default Event Mapping

The Partnerize destination includes a default mapping for essential conversion tracking fields:

| Field      | Description                  | Source                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Order ID   | Unique order identifier      | `event.event_properties.order_id`   |
| Click ID   | Partnerize click tracking ID | `visitor.clid`                      |
| Item ID    | Product or item identifier   | `event.event_properties.item_id`    |
| Item Price | Product or item price        | `event.event_properties.item_price` |

## Required Fields

The following fields are required for successful conversion tracking:

* Program ID (from settings)
* Order ID
* Click ID
* Item ID
* Item Price

If any of these fields are missing, the event will not be dispatched and an error will be logged.

## Tracking Events

To track events through Partnerize, you'll need to ensure your events include the required fields. Here's an example of tracking a purchase event:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('track', 'Purchase', {
    order_id: '12345',
    item_id: 'PROD-123',
    item_price: 99.99
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## When It Dispatches

Our Partnerize integration dispatches events automatically when the required data properties are present. Specifically:

1. **Required Fields**: An event will only be dispatched if all required fields (Program ID, Order ID, Click ID, Item ID, and Item Price) are present.

2. **Retry Logic**: The system includes automatic retry logic for temporary failures, but will stop retrying after 5 attempts to prevent infinite loops.

3. **Integration Type**: The integration type can be customized in the settings, defaulting to 'DYNAMIC' if not specified.

## Error Handling

The destination implements robust error handling:

* Missing required fields will trigger a non-retryable error
* Events that have been retried more than 5 times will be marked as non-retryable
* Error messages clearly indicate which required fields are missing

## Best Practices

1. **Click ID Tracking**: Ensure your implementation properly captures and stores Partnerize click IDs
2. **Order IDs**: Use unique order IDs for each transaction
3. **Testing**: Validate your integration by checking the Partnerize dashboard for successful conversions
4. **Error Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for any error messages in your Ours dashboard
