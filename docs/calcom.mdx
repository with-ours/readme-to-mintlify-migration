# Ours Integration with Cal.com

This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours** with your Cal.com account. You’ll learn how to track bookings and custom events seamlessly while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

## Cal.com Redirect (easy integration)

The simplest way to integrate Ours with Cal.com is to set up a redirect after booking. Here's how:

1. Make sure your Ours tracking script is installed on your website.
2. Link from your website to a Cal.com booking page.
3. Set up a custom thank-you page in Cal.com to redirect back to your website.

On your thank-you page, fire this Ours event:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('track', 'BookingCompleted');
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This method requires no complex integration and provides basic tracking. Configure the redirect in your Cal.com booking page settings:
