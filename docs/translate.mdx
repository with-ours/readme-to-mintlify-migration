## How It Works

When a visitor lands on your site, they’ll see a floating translate button—styled to match your brand. Clicking the button opens a sleek, accessible modal where they can choose from the languages you’ve enabled. As soon as a language is selected, the widget quickly gathers all visible text on the page (skipping hidden elements and forms), and securely sends it to our translation API.
