The **Event Replay** feature in Ours allows you to resend historical events to destinations with precise control.

Whether you need to replay events formatted differently to a destination, resend previously missed events, or reprocess data with updated mappings, Event Replay ensures that your data flows correctly to its intended destinations.

## How Event Replay Works

1. **Query and Select Events**

   * Ours queries and selects the events to replay

   * Different destinations have varying limitations on how old events can be. Destinations also have varying limitations on how old of click IDs you can send over.

   * **Date Range Limitations**:

     * **Facebook**: Events can only be backfilled for up to **7 days**.
     * **Reddit**: Events must be within the last **7 days**.
     * **Google Analytics**: Events are enabled in real-time only.

2. **Dispatch Through Destinations Configuration**

   * Replayed events are dispatched through your current destinations and mappers

   * You can send events to one (or many) destinations during the replay

   * If you need modified mappings that differ from the mappings used for events being sent from your current events:

     1. Set up a **new destination**.
     2. Configure the mappers for the replayed events
     3. Have the events replayed through that new Destinations with the correct mappers

3. **Options**

   * Deduplication Id: You will need to decide if you want us to send the events with a new deduplication ID or with the old deduplication ID. If the events were never sent to that destination, you likely can re-use the deduplication ID. If the events were sent, and we're sending them formatted differently, we should likely generate a new deduplication ID.
   * Event Time: If you want us to set the time parameter in the API call to now (instead of when the event occurred), let us know.

3. **Confirm and Run the Replay**

   * We will verify and confirm your settings with you before sending the replayed events.
