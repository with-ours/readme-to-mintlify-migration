# Installation

To start tracking with Ours Privacy, you can either:

1. Use **Google Tag Manager** (recommended for most users)
2. Use the **Ours Privacy JavaScript SDK** (recommended for engineering teams)

***

## Option 1: Install with Google Tag Manager (Recommended)

You should consider installing Ours Privacy via Google Tag Manager (GTM). It is fast, requires no code, and integrates with your existing GTM setup.

ðŸ“– [Full GTM Instructions â†’](/docs/gtm-install)

### Benefits of GTM Install

* No code required
* Works across your entire site
* Quick setup

When installed, Ours will automatically:

* Capture Advertising Click IDs (e.g., `gclid`, `fbclid`)
* Collect UTM parameters, referrers, and user agent info
* Attempt identity stitching across domains ([Learn more](/docs/visitor-identity-and-matching))

## Option 2: Install with JavaScript SDK

If you have experience editing code, you can install the Ours Privacy SDK directly into your site.

### Steps

1. Go to the [Install Page](https://app.oursprivacy.com/install) in the Ours app.
2. Click **Copy Install Code Directly**.
3. Paste the code snippet into the `<head>` tag of every page on your site.

It is recommended to place it just before the closing `</head>` tag.

**Note:** For React/Vue/Next.js applications, you can also install via NPM: `npm install ours-web-sdk`. See our [Web SDK Documentation](/docs/web-sdk-javascript) for details.

### Tracking Events

After installation, you can track events like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('track', 'Appointment Booked');
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You can use any event name you prefer.
