# Shopify Integration Guide

This guide will help you set up a custom pixel in Shopify using our analytics script. This approach allows you to track various events without the need for a dedicated Shopify app. It publishes all [Shopify Standard Events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events/checkout_started) to Ours.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Access Your Shopify Admin:**

   * Log in to your Shopify admin panel.

2. **Begin setting up the Shopify Customer event**

   * Navigate to `Settings` > `Customer events`
   * Click on `Add custom pixel` and give it a name

3. **Choose an installation option for Ours Privacy:**

   * *Install using Google Tag Manager (GTM)*

     * Login to `tagmanager.google.com`
     * Navigate to `Admin` > `Install Google Tag Manager`
     * Copy the code block from the first section into the Customer event Custom pixel you created in Shopify
     * Delete the lines that start with `<!--` and the `<script>` and `</script>` tags at the beginning and end of the snippet

   * *Install using Ours Privacy Javascript SDK*

     * Login to `app.oursprivacy.com`
     * Click `Copy Web SDK`
     * Paste the copied code into the Customer event Custom pixel you created in Shopify
     * Delete `<script>` and `</script>` at beginning and end of the copied code snippet

4. **Subscribe to all Shopify events:**

   * Add the following code that matches your installation option to the end of the Customer event Custom pixel you created in Shopify:

### GTM Pixel Setup

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  // Step 1. Install GTM
  // paste your GTM code here

  // Step 2. Insert this snippet
  analytics.subscribe("all_standard_events", function(event) {
    var name = event.name;
    var data = event.data;
    var checkout = data && data.checkout;
    var shippingAddress = checkout && checkout.shippingAddress;
    var billingAddress = checkout && checkout.billingAddress;
    var address = shippingAddress || billingAddress; // Fallback to billing if shipping is unavailable

    if (!window.dataLayer) {
      window.dataLayer = [];
    }

    window.dataLayer.push({
      event: name,
      rawData: data,
      email: checkout ? checkout.email : "",
      first_name: address ? address.firstName : "",
      last_name: address ? address.lastName : "",
      phone_number: address ? address.phone : "",
      city: address ? address.city : "",
      state: address ? address.provinceCode : "",
      zip: address ? address.zip : "",
      country: address ? address.countryCode : "",
      currency: checkout ? checkout.currencyCode : "",
      value: checkout ? checkout.totalPrice : ""
    });
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Javascript SDK Pixel Setup

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  // Step 1. Install Ours Privacy
  // paste your Ours install code here

  // Step 2. Insert this snippet
  analytics.subscribe("all_standard_events", (event) => {
    ours("track", event.name, event.data);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Congrats, Ours is now capturing all of your standard Shopify events.
