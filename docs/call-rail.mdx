# Ours Privacy Integration with CallRail

This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours Privacy** with your CallRail account. You'll learn how to track calls, SMS, and form submissions seamlessly while supporting **privacy-focused analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

## CallRail Webhooks (custom integration)

For advanced tracking and to access detailed event data, you can set up a custom integration with CallRail. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Source in Ours Privacy**:

   * In the Ours app, navigate to **Sources** and create a new source.
   * Select **CallRail** from the options and copy the Webhook URL provided.

2. **Subscribe to Webhooks in CallRail**:

   * Go to your CallRail > Integration Settings.

   * Add a new webhook and paste the Ours Webhook URL.

   * Subscribe to the desired events to capture data. Below are the events we recommend:

     * Call completed
     * SMS received
     * SMS sent
     * Form submission received

   * Enable Custom Cookie Capture plugin.
     * Allow "ours\_device\_id" and save.

3. **Submit a Test Event**:

   * Trigger a test event (e.g., make a call or fill out a form) to ensure data is sent to Ours Privacy.
   * Check the Ours Privacy app for pre-populated variables from the event payload.

4. **Map Extra Event Fields**:

   * Use the field mapping interface in Ours Privacy to map CallRail event data to Ours Privacy attributes.
   * The default integration has all important properties mapped. But, you can make custom form fields into Ours Privacy if you wish.
