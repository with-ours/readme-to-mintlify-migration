# Segment Integration

Ours Privacy offers two methods to integrate with Segment, allowing you to leverage your existing Segment implementation without requiring a complete re-tagging of your system.

There are two different modes that we support.

## Device Mode Integration

The device mode integration allows you to load the Ours Privacy plugin alongside your Segment web SDK. This method enables Ours to receive all events sent to Segment directly from your website or application.

### Setup Steps:

1. Enable the Segment device plugin in your Ours portal
2. Copy the provided plugin code
3. Add the plugin to your Segment initialization based on your SDK version:

#### For Segment Analytics.js (Classic):

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  analytics.register(oursPlugin);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### For Segment Analytics Next (Analytics 2.0):

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  analytics.use(oursPlugin);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Once configured, Ours will receive all events sent to Segment, and you can manage them through the Ours portal.

## Server-Side Integration

For server-side event tracking, Ours Privacy supports integration through Segment's webhook functionality.

### Setup Steps:

1. Enable a webhook **source** in your Ours platform
2. Configure a webhook **destination** in your Segment platform
3. Connect the webhook destination to your Ours webhook source

This server-side integration allows you to pipe Segment events directly to the Ours privacy platform while maintaining HIPAA compliance and leveraging our auditing tools.
