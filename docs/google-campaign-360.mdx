# Google Campaign Manager 360

Google Campaign Manager 360 is part of Google Marketing Platform and serves as the central hub for campaign management, measurement, and attribution across Google's comprehensive advertising ecosystem. With this destination, you can send conversion events to Campaign Manager 360 for unified attribution and optimization across Search 360, Display & Video 360, and Floodlight.

## Overview

The Ours integration with Google's Campaign Manager 360 platform enables you to track conversions and other allowed events in a HIPAA-compliant manner. We proxy all events through our server to ensure the advertising platform never directly interacts with your clients' browsers or sees their IP addresses.

This setup allows your Campaign Manager 360 account to receive essential conversion data while maintaining strict privacy and compliance standards.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this destination, ensure you have:

* **A CM360 account that is enabled for API access** (this is the case by default for most CM360 accounts)
* **A user profile in your CM360 account** that has access to the advertiser and Floodlight activities you would like to connect and the "Insert offline conversions" permission

## Setup and Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. To add this destination, click on **Destinations** from your Ours platform
2. Click the **Add destination** button and select **Google Campaign Manager 360** as the destination type
3. Click the **Click to Authenticate Google** button and sign into your account through Google
4. After authenticating, select your **Google Campaign Manager 360 Account**
5. **Save or select an account** - This saves your profile ID for future use

### Destination Configuration

Once authenticated, you'll need to configure mappings for your events. You can pass back an array of options for each event mapping.

**Note:** We automatically collect and store `gclid` and `dclid` on all users, so these parameters are available for mapping without additional configuration.

### Event Mapping Options

When configuring event mappings, you can specify the following options:

* **Event Name**: The name of the event as it appears in your Ours platform
* **Floodlight Activity ID**: The specific Floodlight activity ID where the conversion should be sent
* **Floodlight Configuration ID**: The Floodlight configuration ID for the conversion
* **Conversion Value**: The monetary value associated with the conversion (optional)
* **Currency**: The currency code for the conversion value (optional)
* **Custom Parameters**: Additional parameters specific to your Floodlight configuration

## Implementation

### Basic Event Tracking

After you set up this destination, you can track conversion events using:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('track', "ConversionEventName");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will send an event named "ConversionEventName" to the Ours platform. From there, you can allow it for this destination and configure the appropriate mappings.

### Event Setup Process

1. Create allowed events you want to track in your Ours platform
2. Common events include conversions such as form submissions, sign-ups, and purchases
3. Enable the events and configure the appropriate Floodlight mappings
4. Save your configuration to activate the destination
