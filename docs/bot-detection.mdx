# Bot Detection and Filtering

Ours uses modern bot detection techniques to help you control how automated traffic is handled in your analytics. Depending on your goals, you can either **allow** bots for a more complete view of total traffic or **block** them to improve reporting accuracy by filtering out non-human interactions.

Bot detection and filtering is free and included on all Ours Privacy accounts.

## Bot Control Mode

You can control how bots are handled for each source:

* **Allow**: All traffic, including bots, is recorded and processed like regular events.
* **Block**: Bots are filtered out from your **recent events** and will **not be dispatched to destinations**.

Blocking bots can improve your reporting quality by ensuring that engagement and conversion metrics reflect human behavior. However, if you need a full picture of all incoming traffic—including bot visits—you may choose to keep them allowed.

## Best Practices

* **Block bots for cleaner analytics**: If you're focused on human interactions (e.g., conversion tracking, engagement metrics), enabling bot filtering will provide more reliable data.
* **Allow bots for monitoring and debugging**: If you want a full picture of all traffic sources, including automated monitoring tools and search engine crawlers, keeping bots allowed ensures no data is missing.
* **Review bot activity regularly**: Some platforms (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook) may have different requirements for handling bot-generated traffic. Use Ours’ event logs to monitor trends and adjust your settings as needed.

By configuring bot detection properly, you can maintain accurate analytics while still capturing the data that matters most to your business.
