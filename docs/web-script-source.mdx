---

The **Ours Privacy Web SDK** is a lightweight JavaScript library that enables seamless tracking of events and collection of visitor data directly from your website. This script is a primary source for capturing first-party data and sending it to the Ours platform for processing and distribution.

The Ours Google Tag Manager (GTM) integration uses the Web SDK under-the-hood.

***

## Why Use the Web SDK?

The Web SDK is designed to:

* **Automatically Collect Important Data Across Page Views**:
  * Collect visitor data such as UTM parameters, IP address, referrer, and device details.
* **Track Custom Events**:
  * Send events like form submissions, clicks, or page views with additional properties.
* **Separate Data by Source**:
  * Organize and differentiate data from multiple web properties, enabling precise tracking and reporting.
* **Maintain Privacy Compliance**:
  * Helps adheres to HIPAA and other privacy regulations by leveraging Ours’s hashing and redaction features.

***

## Installing the Ours Privacy Web SDK

**Note:**

* All Ours accounts come with a Web SDK token enabled.
* You can create more than one Web SDK source if you need to track multiple websites that trigger differing destinations
* You can add whitelisted domains to a Web SDK source to block unwanted requests

***

## Features of the Web SDK

### 1. **Default Data Collection**

The Web SDK automatically collects:

* **Ad Tracking Parameters**: `gclid`, `fbclid`, `utm_*`, and other campaign identifiers.
* **Visitor Metadata**: Browser type, operating system, screen resolution, and IP address.
* **Page Details**: Referrer, current URL, and title.

### 2. **Custom Event Tracking**

Track specific interactions using the `ours('track', 'ButtonClick')` function:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('track', 'ButtonClick');
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. **User Property Identification**

Associate user-specific properties with visitors using the `ours('identify')` function:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('identify', { email: '[email protected]'});
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. **Source Segmentation**

If you manage multiple web properties, Ours lets you set up separate **sources** for each property. This ensures data is isolated and reported accurately. Sources also allow you to configure different destinations or mappings for each property.

You can also whitelist domains for each Web SDK source you setup. And, enable/disable them at anytime.

## Debugging the Web SDK

If the Web SDK is not tracking events as expected:

1. **Verify Installation**:
   * Confirm the script is in the `<head>` section of your website.
2. **Check the Dashboard**:
   * Look for tracked events in the [Recent Events Dashboard](/docs/tracking-and-debugging-events).

***

## Privacy and Compliance

The Web SDK adheres to privacy-forward principles, ensuring compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and other privacy laws:

* **Data Security**:
  * Automatically hashes or redacts sensitive user properties before forwarding them to destinations.
* **Customizable Settings**:
  * Use the [Data Mapping](/docs/data-mapping) tool to configure how collected data is handled.
* **Signed Compliance**:
  * Ours offers signed BAAs for HIPAA compliance.

***

## Best Practices for Using the Web SDK

1. **Place the Script in the`<head>`** :
   * Ensure the script loads before any user interaction occurs.
2. **Use Sources for Multiple Properties**:
   * Set up separate sources for each web property to manage data independently.
3. **Track Key Events**:
   * Identify important events (e.g., `PageView`, `Purchase`) and ensure they are tracked consistently.
4. **Minimize Sensitive Data**:
   * Use `identify` sparingly and hash sensitive fields like `email` where possible.
5. **Monitor Data**:
   * Regularly review collected events in the dashboard to verify accuracy and compliance.
