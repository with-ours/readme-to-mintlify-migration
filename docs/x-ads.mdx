## X Ads Features

The Ours X Ads feature enables you to track conversions and other key events through a HIPAA-compliant, server-to-server Conversion API, ensuring that sensitive client data remains private. By routing all events through our servers, Ours prevents X from directly accessing clients' browsers, IP addresses, or other PII and PHI.

This setup gives you the ability to optimize your X Ads campaigns with accurate, privacy-safe data, while remaining compliant with strict healthcare and privacy regulations. With Ours, you can confidently use X Ads without compromising on data protection or client confidentiality.

## Setting Up X Ads

To add a destination, click on [Destinations](https://app.oursprivacy.com/) from your Ours platform. Click the **Add destination** button and select X Ads as the destination type to add.

### Authentication Requirements

The X Ads API requires authentication with an X account that has access to the X Ads account. The authenticating user must have either **Ad Manager** or **Ad Admin** permissions to successfully configure and use the integration.

### Required Configuration

You'll need to provide the following information to configure your X Ads destination:

1. **X Ads Pixel ID**: A short 5-digit string that identifies your X Ads account

   * Example: `x0o1v`
   * This can be found in your X Ads account settings under Tools > Events

2. **Event Mappings**: For each event you want to track, you'll need to create a mapping in Ours that corresponds to a conversion event in your X Ads account. You will need to copy/paste in the Conversion ID from X Ads to Ours Privacy for each event you want to track.

   * Updates to event mappings are made in the **Custom Mappings** section. This ties the name of the event `Purchase` to the corresponding Conversion Event ID `tw-q0o6v-q0o6w`

### Finding Your X Ads Pixel ID

1. Log into your X Ads account
2. Navigate to **Tools** > **Events**
3. Look for your Pixel ID in the Events Manager
4. Copy the 5-digit Pixel ID (e.g., `x0o1v`)

### Finding A Conversion ID From X Ads

To find a conversion ID for an event in X Ads:

1. Go to your Events Manager in X Ads

2. Find your event in the list of events - the ID will be displayed in the "ID" column

3. Alternatively:

   * Click "Edit" on the event
   * Scroll to the Conversion API (CAPI) installation instructions at the bottom
   * Copy the Conversion ID shown there

Once you have the ID, paste it into the corresponding event mapping field in the Ours Privacy App.

### Setting Up Event Mappings

Before you can send events to X Ads, you must:

1. **Create conversion events in X Ads**: Set up all your desired conversion events directly in your X Ads account
2. **Create mappings in Ours**: For each event you want to send, create a mapping that specifies the corresponding X Ads Conversion ID
3. **Configure event properties**: Map the available data fields to your X Ads conversion events

> See the X Ads documentation on how to get the [conversion ID for an event](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-ads-api/measurement/web-conversions/conversion-api)

### Available Mapping Fields

You can map the following data fields to your X Ads conversion events:

* **Email**: User's email address
* **Phone**: User's phone number
* **Click ID**: Automatically captured by Ours from X Ads URLs
* **IP Address**: User's IP address
* **User Agent**: Browser/device information
* **Description**: Custom description field
* **Value**: Conversion value/amount. Exact dollar amount only (IE: 225, *not* 225.00)
* **Number of Items**: Quantity of items in the conversion
* **Distinct ID**: Unique identifier for the user
* **Currency**: ISO 4217 code (Ex: "USD")

### Required Identifiers

**Important**: You must send at least one identifier for each event, otherwise the event will not be sent to X Ads. Valid identifier combinations include:

* Email address
* Phone number
* Click ID
* User Agent + IP Address (sent together)

Ours automatically collects the X Click ID and other available information to enhance your conversion tracking.

## Tracking Events

To start tracking events through Ours, you'll first need to create allowed events you want to track. Common events include conversions such as form submissions, sign-ups, and purchases.

After you enable your allowed events and configure the mappings to your X Ads conversion events, you can track them using:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('track', 'EventName', { 
    value: 100, 
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will send an event named "EventName" to the Ours platform, which will then be forwarded to X Ads using your configured mappings.

## Common X Ads Events

X Ads supports standard and custom conversion event names that you can track. Simply, track events with the [Web SDK](/docs/web-sdk-javascript), [Google Tag Manager](/docs/gtm-install), or the [Ours Privacy API](/reference/track). Then, allow these event names for your X Ads destination and configure their mapper.

### Possible Example Events

* **Purchase**: Track completed purchases
* **Lead**: Track form submissions and lead generation
* **Sign Up**: Track account creations
* **Page View**: Track important page visits
* **Custom Events**: Any custom conversion events you create in X Ads

## Best Practices

1. **Create events in X Ads first**: Always set up your conversion events in X Ads before creating mappings in Ours
2. **Use consistent naming**: Keep event names consistent between your Ours allowed events and X Ads conversion events
3. **Include required identifiers**: Always provide at least one identifier (email, phone, or user agent + IP) for each event
4. **Test your setup**: Verify that events are being received in your X Ads account after configuration
5. **Monitor conversion tracking**: Regularly check your X Ads conversion data to ensure optimal campaign performance

## Troubleshooting

### Events not appearing in X Ads

* Verify that your X Ads Pixel ID is correct
* Ensure you have the proper permissions (Ad Manager or Ad Admin)
* Check that you're sending at least one required identifier
* Confirm that your event mappings are correctly configured with valid X Ads Conversion IDs
* Verify that your conversion events are properly set up in X Ads

### Authentication issues

* Make sure you're using an X account with access to the X Ads account
* Verify that your account has the necessary permissions
* Try re-authenticating if you encounter persistent issues

### Mapping issues

* Double-check that Conversion IDs are correctly copied from X Ads
* Ensure event names match between Ours and X Ads
* Verify that all required fields are properly configured in your mappings

### Time issues

* Please wait a handful of hours (typically 3-4 hours) and checkback. X Ads can sometimes take a while to reflect events within the Ads Platform
