# Web Scanner

Our Web Scanner allows you to monitor third-party scripts present on your website with weekly automated scans. This tool is especially useful for identifying scripts that may affect your site's privacy posture or compliance with privacy regulations.

## How It Works

When you add a URL to the Web Scanner, it:

* **Performs an initial scan** of the homepage and a few additional linked pages to get started.

* **Scans pages from multiple sources** every Monday morning:

  * Links discovered during crawling
  * URLs found in any discovered sitemaps

* **Detects third-party scripts** on each page it visits.

* **Collects cookies and localStorage identifiers** set by third-party scripts and services on your website.

* **Crawls within domain scope**: It follows a hierarchical domain rule:

  * If you configure `example.com`, it will crawl `example.com`, `app.example.com`, `blog.example.com`, etc.
  * If you configure `app.example.com`, it will only crawl `app.example.com` and its subdomains, NOT `example.com`
  * It will not follow links to completely different domains outside your organization's control.

## What to Expect

* **Scans run weekly**, beginning early Monday morning.
* **Pages are discovered** through crawling links found on each page.
* **Only publicly accessible pages** on your domain will be scanned.
* **Scan data is retained for 90 days**. If you need access to older data, contact our team.

## Limitations & Recommendations

* While our scanner makes a best effort to detect all third-party scripts, **we recommend you verify results** with your IT team for full visibility.
* The scanner is intended for general monitoring. It should not be relied on as a full security audit or compliance certification.
* Make sure that the pages you want scanned are easily discoverable from your homepage.
* **Need to scan more pages?** You can configure the maximum number of pages to crawl in your monitor settings.
