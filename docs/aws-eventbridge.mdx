The Amazon EventBridge destination enables you to send your event data to Amazon EventBridge in real-time. This allows you to route events to various AWS services and trigger event-driven workflows.

## Configuration

To set up the Amazon EventBridge destination:

1. Navigate to the Destinations section in your account

2. Click "Add Destination" and select "Amazon EventBridge"

3. Provide the following information:

   * AWS Region
   * Event Bus Name

## Event Format

Events sent to your EventBridge will be in the following format:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "event": "Order Completed",
    "event_properties": {
      "order_id": "12345",
      "total": 99.99
    },
    ... etc
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

* Ensure your EventBridge has appropriate access policies (you will need to contact a member of the Ours Privacy team for this)
* Consider using event patterns for routing events to different targets
