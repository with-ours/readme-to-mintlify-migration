Ours works via a **Published Versions** system. This system lets you add, modify, and delete multiple entities before finally publishing your changes. Whether you're adding new sources, updating data mappings, configuring allowed event names, or setting up new destinations, you can work on all your changes simultaneously and publish them only when you're ready.

## Key Features

* **Batch Changes:** Modify multiple entities at once, including sources, mappings, allowed events, and destinations.
* **Controlled Publishing:** Decide exactly when your changes go live by clicking **Publish**.
* **Change Review:** Review a summary of your changes before publishing to ensure accuracy.
* **Version Naming & Notes:** Assign a name and add notes to each published version to keep track of changes.
* **Version History:** Republish historical versions if needed, making it easy to roll back changes.
* **Live Data Control:** Once published, all data ingested from sources and dispatched to destinations will reference the active published version.

## How It Works

1. **Make Changes:** Add new sources, update mappings, modify allowed events, or add destinations. All changes are tracked as unpublished changes.
2. **Track Changes:** In the top-right corner of the interface, you’ll see the number of unpublished changes compared to the current published version.
3. **Review Changes:** Click **Publish** to view a detailed summary of all pending changes.
4. **Publish Version:** Assign a version name and optional description, then confirm to publish. All changes will go live instantly.
5. **Version History:** Access the **Versions** tab to view, manage, and republish historical versions.

## Troubleshooting Tips

* **Unpublished Changes:** If you’re not seeing expected results in the **Recent Events** view, check for unpublished changes.
* **Version Mismatch:** Ensure the latest version is published, especially after making significant updates.
* **Audit Changes:** Use version notes to document key changes, making it easier to track modifications over time.
