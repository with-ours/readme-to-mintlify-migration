## Overview

The Google Analytics Measurement Protocol destination allows you to send server-to-server and offline events directly to Google Analytics 4. This is particularly useful for tracking events that occur outside of standard web interactions, such as webhook events, server-side processing, or offline conversions.

**Important Note:** For standard web tracking, we recommend using the [Google Analytics (GA4) destination](/docs/google-analytics-ga4) instead. The Measurement Protocol destination is specifically designed for server-to-server and offline event tracking scenarios.

## When to Use Measurement Protocol

Use the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol destination when you need to:

* Send events from webhooks or server-side processes
* Track offline conversions or interactions
* Associate server events with existing web sessions
* Send events from devices or systems where standard GA4 tracking isn't available
* Bridge online and offline user behavior

## Setup and Configuration

### Adding Google Analytics Measurement Protocol as a Destination

To add a destination:

1. Navigate to the [Destinations](https://app.oursprivacy.com/) page in your Ours Privacy platform.
2. Click **Add destination** and select **Google Analytics Measurement Protocol** as the destination type.

### Required Configuration

You'll need to provide two key pieces of information:

#### 1. Measurement ID

1. Go to your Google Analytics 4 property
2. Navigate to **Admin** > **Data Streams**
3. Select your web stream
4. Copy the **Measurement ID** (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

#### 2. API Secret

1. In the same data stream settings
2. Scroll down to **Measurement Protocol API secrets**
3. Click **Create** to generate a new secret
4. Copy the generated **Secret value**

## Event Mapping Requirements

When configuring events for the Measurement Protocol destination, you'll be asked to map two critical identifiers:

### Session ID (sid)

The session ID helps Google Analytics associate your server events with specific user sessions. This should be mapped to a field that contains the session identifier from your web tracking.

### Client ID (cid)

The client ID is the unique identifier for a user across sessions. This should be mapped to a field that contains the client identifier from your web tracking.

## Associating Server Events with Web Sessions

To properly associate server events with existing web sessions in Google Analytics, ensure you have a way to link webhook events to existing visitors. This typically involves:

1. **Capturing identifiers from web sessions**: Store the `client_id` and `session_id` from your web tracking
2. **Including these identifiers in server events**: When sending events via webhooks or server-side processes, include the same `client_id` and `session_id`
3. **Mapping in Ours Privacy**: Configure the destination to map these fields correctly

### Example Implementation

When a user completes a web form that triggers a server-side webhook:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  // Ours Privacy mapping to associate back to same session id and client id:
  {
    "event_name": "form_processed",
    "client_id": "{{visitor.cid}}",
    "session_id": "{{visitor.sid}}"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Event Tracking

### Standard and Custom Events

You can send any standard GA4 events or custom events through the Measurement Protocol. Common use cases include:

* **Purchase events**: Track offline purchases or server-processed transactions
* **Lead events**: Track form submissions processed server-side
* **Custom events**: Track any business-specific interactions

### Event Property Limitations

When sending events via Measurement Protocol, please note the following limitations:

* Each event can have a maximum of 20 event properties
* Each event property value must be fewer than 1,000 characters
* Event names are limited to 40 characters

[See all restrictions here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/sending-events?client_type=gtag)

## Best Practices

1. **Use the standard GA4 destination for web events**: Reserve the Measurement Protocol for server-side and offline events only
2. **Maintain consistent identifiers**: Ensure `client_id` and `session_id` are consistent between web and server events
3. **Send events promptly**: For session attribution, send Measurement Protocol events within 24 hours of the session start
4. **Validate your setup**: Use Google Analytics DebugView to verify events are being received correctly
