## Snapchat Ads Features

The Ours Snapchat Ads feature allows you to securely track conversions and other allowed events for Snapchat Ads in a HIPAA-compliant manner. By routing all events through our server, we ensure that Snapchat never interacts directly with your clients' browsers. We also allow you to redact and/or hash data before it is sent over to Snapchat.

With Ours, you can capture meaningful engagement data while safeguarding privacy, helping your Snapchat Ads account stay compliant and optimized with actionable insights.

Ours automatically captures Snapchat click ids from the URL query string and saves them for dispatching future events.

The Snapchat Conversion API allows Ours to send events directly from our servers to Snapchat's servers, bypassing the client browser. This server-to-server connection enhances privacy by keeping user information secure and avoiding direct exposure of user data to Snapchat.

## Configuring a Snapchat destination

To add a destination, click on [Destinations](https://app.oursprivacy.com/) from your Ours platform. Click the **Add destination** button and select Snapchat as the destination type to add.

Then, copy and paste your **Pixel ID** and **Snapchat Conversion API Key** into the Ours destination configuration tool. After successful configuration, you will see a message that says "Your destination is configured and ready."

### Find your Pixel ID

1. Go to Snapchat Ads Manager
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Pixel**
3. Find your Pixel ID in the list of available pixels
4. Copy and paste that **Pixel ID** into the Ours destination configuration tool

### Find your Snapchat Conversion API Key

1. In the Snapchat Ads Manager, go to **Settings** > **Pixel**
2. Select your pixel and navigate to the **Conversion API** section
3. Generate a new access token if you haven't already
4. Copy the access token provided
5. Copy and paste that **Snapchat Conversion API Key** into the Ours destination configuration tool

## Standard Snapchat Events

Snapchat supports a variety of standard events that you can track. If you want to use a Standard Snapchat event name, you can either:

* Create an allowed event with the same name as a Standard Snapchat Event name

or

* Use an existing allowed event and rename for your Snapchat destination to a standard event name

Below are some common standard events that Snapchat supports:

### Purchase

When a purchase is made or checkout flow is completed.

**Properties** `currency` (required) `value` (required) `content_ids` `content_type` `contents` `num_items`

  ours('track', 'Purchase', { value: 100, currency: 'USD' });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### AddToCart

## When It Dispatches

Our Snapchat integration dispatches events automatically when the required data properties are present. Specifically:

1. **Necessary Properties**: An event will be dispatched if it includes both the Snapchat Pixel ID and Conversion API Key. Additionally, the visitor must have a unique identifier for the event to be valid for Snapchat.

2. **Event Type**: Dispatch occurs only if the event matches a recognized action type within your Snapchat configuration.

3. **Automatic Retry**: If the Snapchat API returns an error indicating a retry is required, such as an API error or temporary issue, the system will automatically attempt to re-dispatch the event.

This setup ensures that events are only dispatched to Snapchat when sufficient configuration and visitor data are present, maintaining efficient and accurate ad interaction tracking.
