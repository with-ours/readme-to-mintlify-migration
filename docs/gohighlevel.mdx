# Ours Integration with GoHighLevel

[GoHighLevel](https://www.gohighlevel.com/) is an all-in-one marketing and sales platform that empowers businesses to automate workflows, capture leads, and manage customer journeys. This guide will show you how to integrate **Ours** with GoHighLevel using webhooks, enabling you to track events and automate data flows while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

> **GoHighLevel supports integration via webhooks.** Learn more in their [official webhook documentation](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001219775-workflow-action-webhook).

## Overview: How the Integration Works

GoHighLevel's [Workflow Builder](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001219775-workflow-action-webhook) allows you to trigger webhooks based on events such as new leads, form submissions, appointment bookings, and more. By configuring a webhook action, you can send event data from GoHighLevel directly to Ours for analytics, automation, and compliance.

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Create a Webhook Source in Ours

* In the Ours app, navigate to **Sources** and create a new source.
* Select **Webhook** as the source type and copy the unique Webhook URL provided by Ours.

### 2. Set Up a Workflow in GoHighLevel

* Log in to your [GoHighLevel dashboard](https://www.gohighlevel.com/).
* Go to **Automation > Workflows** and create a new workflow or edit an existing one.
* Add a **Trigger** (e.g., form submission, new lead, appointment booked, etc.).
* Click **+ Add Action** and select **Webhook**.
* Paste the Ours Webhook URL into the **Webhook URL** field.
* Optionally, customize the payload to include relevant data (contact info, event type, etc.).
