# Ours Integration with WordPress

This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours** with your WordPress website. You’ll learn how to install the Ours tracking script, track page views, and log custom events—all while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

## Integration Options

The integration guide below covers using the [Ours Privacy Web SDK](/docs/web-sdk-javascript).

If you want to use Google Tag Manager instead, you can ignore the code examples and use traditional [Google Tag Manager Triggers](/docs/gtm-install) to fire your events.

Choose the approach that best suits your workflow.

## Install

To integrate Ours with your WordPress website, you’ll need to install the Ours tracking script. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Install Ours](https://app.oursprivacy.com/install) page in your Ours account.

2. Copy the script provided on that page.

3. Add the script to your WordPress site using one of these methods:

   * **Using a Plugin**: We recommend using a plugin such as [Insert Headers and Footers](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/) or [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/).
     * Paste the script into the **Header** section of the plugin settings.

   * **Directly in the Theme**:

     * Navigate to **Appearance > Theme Editor** in your WordPress admin dashboard.
     * Open the `header.php` file of your active theme.
     * Paste the script just before the closing `</head>` tag.

Save your changes and verify the script is included on all pages of your website.

## Tracking Page Views

By default, **Ours does not automatically track page views**. You need to explicitly track them by adding the following line **after the`ours('init', ...)` call** in the script:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  <!-- Ours Pixel Code -->
  <script>
   // your install code is here

   ours('track', 'PageView');
  </script>
  <!-- End Ours Pixel Code -->
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This ensures page views are logged correctly in Ours.

## Track Events

To track custom events such as form submissions or button clicks, you can add the `ours('track', ...)` function in your WordPress code or using custom JavaScript. You can place this in the plugin settings (if using a plugin like **Insert Headers and Footers**) or directly within your site’s JavaScript files.

### Example: Tracking Button Clicks

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  <button onclick="ours('track', 'ButtonClicked');">Contact Us</button>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Example: Tracking Form Submissions

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  <form onsubmit="ours('track', 'FormSubmit');">
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
  ```
</CodeGroup>
