# Domain Whitelisting

Domain whitelisting is a critical security feature that restricts Ours Privacy SDKs to only load and function on approved domains. This prevents unauthorized usage of your tracking tokens and ensures that your analytics data remains secure and accurate.

***

## What is Domain Whitelisting?

Domain whitelisting allows you to specify exactly which domains are authorized to use your Ours Privacy SDKs. When enabled, the SDKs will only load and function on domains that have been explicitly added to your whitelist.

This security measure prevents:

* Unauthorized usage of your tracking tokens on competitor websites
* Data pollution from unexpected domains
* Potential security vulnerabilities from token exposure
* Unintended analytics data from unknown sources

***

## Why Domain Whitelisting is Essential

### Security Benefits

* **Controls Data Access**: Ensures only your approved domains can send data to your Ours Privacy account
* **Reduces Attack Surface**: Limits potential security vulnerabilities to your whitelisted domains only

### Data Quality Benefits

* **Prevents Data Pollution**: Eliminates analytics noise from unauthorized usage
* **Maintains Data Integrity**: Ensures all tracked data comes from your legitimate properties
* **Improves Attribution Accuracy**: Prevents incorrect attribution of traffic and conversions

### Compliance Benefits

* **Enhanced Privacy Control**: Ensures data collection only occurs on domains you control
* **Audit Trail**: Provides clear documentation of which domains are authorized to collect data

***

## Supported SDKs

Domain whitelisting is available for four Ours Privacy services:

* **[Web SDK](/docs/web-sdk-javascript)**: Control where your main analytics tracking can load and function
* **[Session Replay](/docs/session-replay)**: Restrict session recording to authorized domains
* **[Consent Management Platform](/docs/ours-privacy-cmp)**: Control where consent collection occurs
* **[Translation Widget](/docs/translate)**: Restrict translation functionality to authorized domains

***

## Summary

Domain whitelisting is an essential security feature that should be enabled for all Ours Privacy SDKs. By restricting SDK functionality to authorized domains only, you prevent unauthorized usage, maintain data quality, and enhance your overall security posture.

**Key Benefits:**

* Prevents unauthorized token usage
* Maintains data integrity and quality
* Enhances security and compliance
* Provides clear audit trails

**Next Steps:**

* Configure domain whitelisting for your Web SDK, Session Replay, CMP, and Translation Widget
* Review and maintain your authorized domain list regularly
* Monitor for any unauthorized usage attempts
