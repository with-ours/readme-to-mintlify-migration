# Ours Privacy Integration with Salesforce

This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours Privacy** with your Salesforce account. You'll learn how to send events to Ours Privacy when data changes or when users take actions in Salesforce, all while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

## Before You Begin

To use Ours Privacy with Salesforce, you must first create a **Server API** in the Ours Privacy dashboard. This will generate a server-specific token, which is different from the token used by our Web SDK (such as those embedded in GTM or JavaScript snippets).

<Info>
  ### Tokens used with the Web SDK will not work for Salesforce or any other server-side integration.
</Info>

<Info>
  ### For more information about server-to-server integrations, see our [Server API Integration guide](/docs/server-to-server-integration).
</Info>

To create a new API Source:

1. Go to your Ours Privacy dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Sources** and click **"Add Source"**.
3. Choose **Server API**.
4. Save the token that's generated – you'll use this in your Salesforce HTTP Callout.

Also, make sure the JSON you send in the body of the request is valid. You can use tools like [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com) to validate your payloads.

## Using the Ours Privacy Salesforce Event Action in Flow

Salesforce Flow Builder now allows you to create HTTP callouts without code, making it easy to send data to Ours Privacy whenever important events occur in your Salesforce instance. Here's how to use this feature:

### What You Can Track

With this integration, you can send events to Ours Privacy when:

* A lead is created or updated
* An opportunity stage changes
* A case is closed
* A custom object is modified
* Users take specific actions in Salesforce
* Any other event you can build a Flow for

### Creating a Flow with Ours Privacy HTTP Callout

1. **Create a New Flow in Salesforce**:

   * Navigate to **Setup > Flow > New Flow**
   * Select the appropriate flow type (Record-Triggered, Schedule-Triggered, etc.)

2. **Add the Ours Privacy HTTP Callout Action**:

   * In your flow, click on the **+** button to add a new element
   * Select **Action**
   * Choose **Create HTTP Callout**
   * Select your Named Credential (set up as described in the setup section below)

3. **Configure the HTTP Request and Body**:

   * Set the **Method** to **POST**
   * Enter your Ours Privacy endpoint URL (e.g., `https://api.oursprivacy.com/api/v1/track`)
   * Configure the body of the request to contain all the information you would like to send back to Ours Privacy. You can [build your payload here](/reference/track#/)
   * At a minimum, you would need this:
   * <CodeGroup>
       ```bash bash
       {
         "event": "Event Name",
         "token": "{{ours token}}"
       }
       ```
     </CodeGroup>

4. **Activate Your Flow**:

   * Save and activate your flow to start sending events to Ours Privacy
   * **Note:** If you are triggering the Ours Privacy Salesforce Action off of a object event (like contact created, account updated, etc), you will need to include the action in an async logic branch of your flow statement.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I use a Web SDK token?

The request will fail silently or be rejected. Web SDK tokens are intended for browser-based integrations. Always use a **Server API Source** token for Salesforce.

### My events aren't showing up in Ours Privacy — what could be wrong?

* Double-check that you are using the **correct token** from a Server API Source.
* Make sure the JSON payload is properly formatted and valid.
* Ensure that your HTTP Callout points to the correct API endpoint: `https://api.oursprivacy.com/api/v1/track`

### Where can I test my payload format?

You can validate and preview your payload using the [Track API Explorer](/reference/track#/).
