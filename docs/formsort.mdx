# Ours Integration with Formsort

This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours** with your Formsort account. Youâ€™ll learn how to track form submissions and custom events seamlessly while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

## Formsort Redirect (easy integration)

The simplest way to integrate Ours with Formsort is to set up a redirect within Formsort. Here's how:

1. Make sure your Ours tracking script is installed on your website.
2. Link from your website to Formsort.
3. Set up a custom thank-you page in Formsort to redirect back to your website.

On your thank-you page, fire this Ours event:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  ours('track', 'FormSubmitted', { conversion: true });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This method requires no complex integration and provides basic tracking. Configure the redirect in your Formsort settings:

## Ours Formsort Source (custom integration)

For more advanced tracking and to access form submission details, you can use the Ours custom Formsort integration:

1. **Create a New Source**:

   * In the Ours app, navigate to **Sources** and create a new source.
   * Select **Formsort** from the options and copy the Webhook URL provided.

2. **Add Webhook in Formsort**:

   * Paste the Webhook URL into Formsort under the integration settings for your flow.

3. **Submit a Test Form**:

   * Fill out your form to ensure data is sent to Ours.
   * Check the Ours app for pre-populated variables from the form payload.

4. **Map Form Fields**:

   * Use the field mapping interface in Ours to map Formsort data to Ours attributes.
   * Include at least the **Ours visitor ID** and optionally an email address for user association.

### Advanced Source Integration

To link Ours visitor data with Formsort submissions:

1. **Add a Hidden Field in Formsort**:

   * Set up a hidden field in your form to capture the **Ours User ID**.

2. **Pass Visitor ID via URL**:

   * When linking to the Formsort form, append the Ours User ID as a URL parameter.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  <a id='form-link' href="https://formsort.com/form/123?ours_user_id={{ours_user_id}}">Start Form</a>

  <script>
  const link = document.getElementById('form-link');
  link.setAttribute('href', 'https://formsort.com/form/123?ours_user_id='+localStorage.getItem('ours_device_id'));
  </script>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You'll then want to map that hidden field to the Ours visitor id in the Ours mapper settings.

That's it ðŸŽ‰!
