## Overview

The Ours Privacy Video Platform allows you to upload videos and play them back in a **HIPAA-compliant** way. If you are building a marketing site or any webpage requiring **sensitive video playback**, Ours Privacy ensures that your videos remain secure while still being accessible.

You can either:

1. **Use Ours Privacy Video Embed** – A fully featured embed system that handles **playback, transcripts, and SEO metadata**.
2. **Build Your Own Player** – Retrieve the **raw video file, transcript, and poster** and use your favorite video playback library.

## Uploading Videos

You can upload videos in the following formats:

* **MP4**
* **WebM**
* **MOV**
* **WEBM**

After uploading, Ours Privacy will **encode and transcode** your videos to ensure compatibility across all browsers. Additionally, Ours Privacy will **automatically generate transcripts and a poster image**, which can be customized in the app.

If you require assistance importing a large number of existing videos, contact us for support.

## Using Ours Privacy Video Embed

The Ours Privacy embed system provides:

* **Automatic transcript handling**

* **SEO metadata optimization** (enhancing search visibility)

* **Customizable embed options**

  * **Branding colors**
  * **Autoplay settings**
  * **Aspect Ratio** - The video embed player defaults to 16:9 aspect ratio. But, you can customize this in the embed settings and upload vertical video (9:16) if you want.

Using Ours Privacy's embed helps compliance with HIPAA regulations, preventing unauthorized tracking and avoiding potential exposure of **PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or PHI (Protected Health Information)** to third-party video platforms.

### How to Embed a Video

1. Upload your video to Ours Privacy.
2. Customize the embed options using the form builder.
3. Copy the **embed code** and paste it into your site.

The embed system **leverages a CDN** for fast delivery and has **no rate limits**.

### Analytics Events

Ours Privacy automatically tracks video analytics events that can be integrated with Google Analytics 4 (GA4):

* **video\_start** - Triggered when a video begins playing
* **video\_progress** - Triggered at specific completion milestones (10%, 25%, 50%, and 75%)
* **video\_complete** - Triggered when a video finishes playing

These events follow GA4's event tracking format for consistency. If you have GA4's automatic page view tracking enabled, Ours Privacy will automatically forward all video events to your GA4 instance.

Each video event includes the following data:

* **current\_time** - Current playback position in seconds
* **video\_duration** - Total duration of the video in seconds
* **video\_percent** - Percentage of video completed
* **video\_url** - URL of the video being played

This analytics data helps you understand viewer engagement and optimize your video content. If you create a custom player, you will have to implement these analytics yourself.

## Building Your Own Player

If you prefer to use a custom video player, you can retrieve:

* The **raw video file** (in various formats)
* The **transcript file**
* The **poster image**

Then, use your preferred video playback library (e.g., **Video.js**, **HLS.js**, **React Player**).

### Example Workflow for a Custom Player:

1. Copy the video file URL from Ours Privacy.
2. Copy the transcript file (optional).
3. Copy the poster image (optional).
4. Use a video player library to display the video.
