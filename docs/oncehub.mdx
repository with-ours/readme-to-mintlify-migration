# Ours Integration with OnceHub

This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours** with your OnceHub account. You'll learn how to track bookings and custom events seamlessly while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious applications.

## OnceHub Redirect (easy integration)

The simplest way to integrate Ours with OnceHub is to set up a redirect after booking. Here's how:

1. Make sure your Ours tracking script is installed on your website
   * This ensures your visitors are properly cookied and attributed before they book
2. Create a new [Redirect Source](/docs/redirect-source) in your Ours app and name is "Once Hub"
3. Copy/paste the Redirect Url inside of OnceHub

This method requires no complex setup and due to Ours Server-Set cookies is able to automatically attribute your events to historical website visitors. This means you don't have to pass any user ids or emails to the redirect link for it to work.

## Advanced On-Page Tracking

For more advanced tracking and to access booking details, you can set up on-page tracking using OnceHub's JavaScript function. Follow these steps:

   * Add the JavaScript OnceHub requires [per their documentation](https://developers.oncehub.com/reference/embedded-booking-calendar-events)

2. **Embed your OnceHub Booking Page**:

3. **Track Ours Events**:

   * Inside of the `SOAfterConfirmationFunction` OnceHub has you define, include a `ours('track', 'Schedule');` event.

### Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  function SOAfterConfirmationFunction(data) {
     ours('track', 'Schedule', data);
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
