---

The AWS Lambda destination allows you to send your event data directly to AWS Lambda functions in real-time. This enables serverless processing of your events using AWS's serverless compute service. With AWS Lambda, you can perform custom processing on your events such as:

* Data transformation and enrichment
* Custom hashing or encryption
* Data validation and sanitization
* Integration with other AWS services
* Custom storage logic
* Real-time analytics processing

## Configuration

To set up the AWS Lambda destination:

1. Navigate to the Destinations section in your account

2. Click "Add Destination" and select "AWS Lambda"

3. Provide the following information:

   * AWS Region
   * Lambda Function Name

## Event Format

Events sent to your Lambda function will be in the following format:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "event": {
      "name": "Order Completed",
      ...etc
    },
    "visitor": {
      "email": "[emailÂ protected]",
      ...etc
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

* Ensure your Lambda function has appropriate access policies (you will need to contact a member of the Ours Privacy team for this)
* Consider using environment variables for configuration
* Implement proper error handling and retry logic in your Lambda function
* Monitor Lambda function performance and set appropriate timeouts
* Use AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring
