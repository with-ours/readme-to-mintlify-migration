The AWS SNS destination enables you to publish your event data to Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics in real-time. This allows you to fan out events to multiple subscribers, including SQS queues, Lambda functions, and HTTP endpoints.

## Configuration

To set up the AWS SNS destination:

1. Navigate to the Destinations section in your account

2. Click "Add Destination" and select "AWS SNS"

3. Provide the following information:

   * AWS Region
   * SNS Topic ARN

## Event Format

Events published to your SNS topic will be in the following format:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "event": "Order Completed",
    "event_properties": {
      "order_id": "12345",
      "total": 99.99
    },
    ... etc
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

* Ensure your SNS topic has appropriate access policies (you will need to contact a member of the Ours Privacy team for this)
* Consider using message attributes for filtering
