description: "Send your event data in real-time to engineering-focused destinations"

Programmatic Destinations are designed for real-time, event-by-event delivery to engineering-focused endpoints. Unlike Warehouse Destinations that batch process data, Programmatic Destinations immediately forward each event as it occurs to your configured endpoint.

These destinations are ideal for:

* Webhooks and API endpoints
* Cloud functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)
* Message queues (Google Pub/Sub, Amazon SNS)

Configuration is handled through our platform's interface, similar to other destination types. Once set up, events are automatically routed to your endpoint as they occur, with minimal latency between event ingestion and delivery.

Common use cases include:

* Real-time event processing
* Instant data synchronization
* Ad conversion tracking
* Webhook-based integrations
* Event-driven architectures
