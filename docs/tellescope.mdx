This guide will walk you through integrating **Ours** with your [Tellescope](http://tellescope.com/) account using Google Tag Manager (GTM). You'll learn how to track patient interactions and clinical events seamlessly while ensuring **HIPAA-compliant analytics** for privacy-conscious healthcare applications.

## Setting Up Tellescope Integration

Follow these steps to set up the integration:

1. **Enable GTM Access on Tellescope**:

   * Contact Tellescope support to enable Google Tag Manager on your website
     * With Google Tag Manager enabled, corresponding dataLayer pushes will be emitted for each form step
   * They will provide you with the necessary permissions and access

2. **Install Ours via GTM**:

   * Follow our [GTM Installation Guide](/docs/gtm-install) to set up Ours
   * Create the Ours Privacy template in GTM
   * Save your Ours Privacy token as a variable
   * Create a GTM tag to install Ours Privacy
   * Configure event tracking tags as needed

3. **Configure Event Tracking**:

   * Create tags in GTM to track relevant Tellescope events
   * Map clinical fields and patient interactions
   * Ensure proper event naming for consistency

4. **Test the Integration**:

   * Use GTM's Preview mode to test your tags
   * Verify that events are being sent to Ours
   * Check the Ours app for incoming data

## Key Features

### Event Tracking

Track various Tellescope events:

* **Patient Interactions**: Monitor patient engagement and interactions
* **Clinical Events**: Track important clinical activities
* **Custom Events**: Configure additional events based on your needs

All dataLayer event types:

* Forms

  * `public_form_start` - the user submitted the first step of the form
  * `form_submitted` - the user has submitted the final step of the form.
  * `form_progress` - the user has made it to the next step in the form (fires in parallel to `public_form_start` and `form_submitted`

* Appointments

  * `booking_widget_loaded` - the booking widget has loaded on site.
  * `selected_time` - the user has selected a time on the calendar to book an appointment
  * `completed_intake` - the user has completed the intake form for the booking
  * `completed_booking` - the user has completed the booking for the appointment

All parameter event types:

* Forms

  * `formId` - The corresponding ID of the form
  * `previousTitle` - The corresponding Title of the field that was just completed
  * `fieldId` - The corresponding ID of the next field
  * `title` - The corresponding Title of the next field
  * `status` - The corresponding Status of the next field

Things to consider:

* Some parameters are optional, meaning that if the form does not have a title or status, then those values may be exempt from the dataLayer push.
* The fieldId, title and status fields are also in reference to the next step within the process, not the step that was already completed. Meaning if a user completed step 1, the `fieldId`, `title`, and `status` values will reflect step 2 (which the user is landing on). To grab the value for the field completed, please reference `previousTitle` instead.
* Events are sent from Google Tag Manager to the Ours Privacy App so any potential PII/PHI will be scrubbed before hitting the destination. This allows the user to have full control of the events to be captured, modified, and sent.

### HIPAA-Compliant Data Handling

Our integration ensures secure data handling:

* **Secure Data Transmission**: All data flows through Ours Privacy's secure infrastructure
* **Encrypted Communication**: All tracking uses HTTPS with proper authentication
* **Minimal Data Exposure**: Only essential identifiers are tracked
* **Secure Data Storage**: Sensitive information is stored according to HIPAA guidelines

### Clinical Analytics

Gain insights into your practice's performance:

* **Patient Engagement**: Track patient interactions and engagement
* **Clinical Activity**: Monitor clinical events and activities
* **Custom Analytics**: Create custom reports based on tracked events
