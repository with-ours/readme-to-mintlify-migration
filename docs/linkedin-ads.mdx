## LinkedIn Ads Features

The Ours LinkedIn Ads feature allows you to:

* Send conversions directly to LinkedIn using the Conversions API.
* Map event data to LinkedIn conversion actions seamlessly.
* Comply with LinkedIn's privacy and security requirements while gaining actionable insights into your ad performance.

## Configure LinkedIn Ads Destination

1. **Authentication**:

   * Follow the LinkedIn Authorization Flow in the Ours app to connect your account.
   * Select the LinkedIn Ad account you want to connect in the Select drop down.

2. **Add events to the Allow List**:

   * Potentially rename the events specifically for LinkedIn

3. **Mapping Events**:

   * Review the default mapping to understand if you want to setup a custom mapping.

## Tracking Events

To track events in LinkedIn, you'll first need to create and allowed events you want to track. Common events include conversions such as form submissions, sign-ups, and purchases. After you enable a few allowed events and potentially rename them, you can click the "Sync" button to sync them with LinkedIn Ads.

If you wish to create the conversion events in LinkedIn Ads yourself, you should create them before clicking the Sync button.

## Visitor Properties

LinkedIn does accept user properties via their API. By default, Ours will only send this data if:

* You send properties like `first_name`, `last_name`, `company_name` and `job_title`
* You configure the destination to send user data to LinkedIn Ads

This enables you to cleanly separate sensitive user data and control what is shared with LinkedIn.

## Required Identifiers

To send events to LinkedIn, you must provide **either** an email address or a LinkedIn Click ID (`li_fat_id`). At least one of these identifiers is required for successful event delivery.

* **Email**: The user's email address.
* **LinkedIn Click ID (`li_fat_id`)**: A unique identifier from LinkedIn's click tracking.

## Name Requirements

If you send a `first_name` field, you **must also** send a `last_name` field. LinkedIn requires both first and last names to be present if either is provided.

## When It Dispatches

Our LinkedIn integration dispatches events automatically when the required data properties are present. Specifically:

1. **Necessary Properties**: An event will be dispatched if the LinkedIn Account is authenticated and selected. And, the event is on your allowed event list.

2. **User Has LinkedIn Query Param Id**: The user has a click ID from LinkedIn.

3. **Automatic Retry**: If the LinkedIn API returns an error that suggests retrying (such as a temporary API issue), the system will automatically attempt to re-dispatch the event.

This configuration ensures that events are only dispatched to LinkedIn when all necessary configuration and visitor data are present, providing reliable tracking of ad interactions.
