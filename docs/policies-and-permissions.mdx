# Policies and Permissions

Our platform provides a comprehensive policies and permissions system that gives you enterprise-grade control over user access and capabilities within your organization. This system includes predefined user roles, custom policy creation, individual user permission management, and robust security controls.

## Policy Management

Create and manage custom policies to define specific permission sets for different user groups:

### Custom Policy Creation

Define policies with descriptive names and purposes to help identify their intended use cases. Policies can be created to match specific business requirements, compliance needs, or team structures.

### Granular Permission Control

Configure individual permissions within each policy, including specific actions like:

* `allowedEvent:find` - View allowed event details
* `allowedEvent:create` - Create new allowed events
* `allowedEvent:delete` - Delete allowed events
* `allowedEvent:update` - Modify existing allowed events
* `allowedEvent:list` - List all allowed events

### Permission Categories

Organize permissions by categories and actions to streamline policy configuration and management:

* **Event Management**: Control access to event creation, viewing, editing, and deletion
* **Billing**: Manage billing information access and modifications
* **Consent Settings**: Control consent management and configuration capabilities
* **User Management**: Manage user invitations, role assignments, and account modifications
* **Organization Settings**: Control organization-level configuration and management
* **Data Access**: Manage access to sensitive data and PHI-related information

### PHI Access Tracking

Monitor which permissions include access to Protected Health Information (PHI) for compliance and security oversight. This feature helps organizations maintain HIPAA compliance and track access to sensitive healthcare data.

### Policy Assignment

Easily assign multiple policies to individual users, providing flexible and comprehensive access control. Users can have multiple policies applied, with permissions being evaluated based on the combined policy set.

## User Permission Management

Manage individual user permissions with precision:

### Individual User Configuration

Configure permissions for each user independently, allowing for highly customized access control that matches specific job responsibilities and security requirements.

### Inline Permission Editing

Modify user permissions directly through an intuitive interface with search and filtering capabilities. The interface provides real-time feedback and clear indicators of permission changes.

### Permission Summary

View comprehensive summaries of allowed and denied permissions for each user, including PHI access tracking. This provides clear visibility into what each user can access and helps with compliance audits.

### Audit Trail

Track all permission changes with detailed logging for compliance and security purposes. Every permission modification is recorded with timestamp, user, and change details.

## Best Practices

### Policy Design

* Create policies based on job functions rather than individual users
* Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the policy's purpose
* Regularly review and update policies as organizational needs change
