# Ours Privacy SDK Overview

Welcome to the overview of our SDKs! This page will walk you through the differences between our **Web** and **React Native** SDKs and our **server ingest** methods, and introduce you to our available tools and testing resources.

It should help you decide which SDK is best for your use case.

***

## Web and React Native SDKs

[Web SDK Docs](/docs/web-sdk-javascript) | [React Native SDK Docs](/docs/react-native-sdk)

The key difference between our Web/React Native SDKs and our server SDKs is that these **client-based SDKs have automated tracking**.

Both the Web and React Native SDKs automatically track certain default properties, including:

* Page URLs
* Query parameters (such as click IDs)
* Other context-based data (e.g., referrer, user agent)

**Web SDK Installation Options:**

* **Script Tag**: Traditional installation via HTML `<script>` tag (recommended for most websites)
* **NPM Package**: Modern installation via `npm install ours-web-sdk` (recommended for React/Vue/Next.js apps)

Additional points:

* The Web SDK is used under the hood by our Google Tag Manager (GTM) integration.
* These SDKs expose easy-to-use methods (e.g., `ours('track', 'Event Name')`) and handle batching, retrying, and default property hydration for you.
* They generally assume they are running on the end user's device.

## Server Ingest API

Our server-side ingest API assumes that you are sending requests from a server on behalf of a user.

This API is described by an **OpenAPI** specification, and we provide **first-party SDKs** in several languages. These SDKs allow you to send data, track events, and identify users or accounts directly from your server-side code.

### Available Server SDKs

* **Node.js**
* **PHP**
* **Python**

More SDKs are coming soon. You can find the full list in the sidebar of our documentation.

### Ingest API Testing Center

Before fully integrating with our server ingest methods, you can experiment and validate your payloads using our **[Ingest API Testing Center](/reference/track)**. This tool lets you:

* Construct and send requests to our ingest endpoint
* Inspect real-time responses
* Verify your event payloads
* Familiarize yourself with our OpenAPI specification

## Next Steps

1. **Web & React Native SDKs**

   * Continue exploring the guides for our Web and React Native SDKs to set up automatic tracking for your website or mobile apps.

2. **Server-Side SDKs**

   * Check out our first-party SDKs for Node.js, PHP, Python, and more (in the sidebar) to integrate directly from your server or backend services.

3. **Ingest API Testing Center**

   * Use the [Testing Center](/reference/track) to try out event payloads, get a feel for the API, and ensure everything is working before going live.

If you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to explore the rest of our documentation or reach out to our support team.
