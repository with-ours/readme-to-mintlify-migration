# Test Mode

## What is Test Mode?

Test Mode is a safe environment where you can validate your analytics setup without sending actual data to your configured destinations. It allows you to:

* Debug your analytics implementation
* Verify event tracking configurations
* Test integrations
* Ensure everything works as expected before going live

## Setting Up Test Mode

### Using Test Tokens

1. Log into your Ours Privacy dashboard
2. Navigate to your source (Web SDK, GTM, or API)
3. Copy the test token provided
4. Use this test token in your implementation

Any event sent using a test token will automatically be processed in test mode.

## How Test Mode Works

### Event Processing

When you use Test Mode:

* ✅ Events are fully captured and processed
* ✅ Events are stored in your dashboard
* ✅ Dispatch objects are created
* ❌ No data is sent to external destinations

### Viewing Test Events

1. Go to the **Recent Events** view in your dashboard
2. Look for events marked with a "Test" indicator
3. Review the intended destinations (where events would be sent in live mode)

## Debugging Workflow

1. **Implement**: Set up your analytics with the test token
2. **Trigger**: Generate events on your site or application
3. **Validate**: Check the Recent Events view to confirm proper tracking
4. **Review**: Verify event properties and intended destinations
5. **Go Live**: Switch to your live token once everything is working correctly

## Benefits

* Debug without affecting production data
* Safe testing environment
* Full visibility into event processing
* Real-time validation
* Verify destination configurations

## Next Steps

Once you've completed testing:

1. Replace the test token with your live token
2. Verify that events are being sent to their intended destinations
3. Monitor your live events to ensure everything continues working as expected
